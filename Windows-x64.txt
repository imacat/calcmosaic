Information running on Windows x64

    If you are running on MS Windows x64, you might not be able to
run calcmosaic.jar just by double-clicking it.  If you go to the
command line and run:

java -jar calcmosaic.jar

    You may see the following error message

Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError:
C:\Users\<login>\AppData\Local\Temp\unowinreg1072712583236131558.dll:
Can't load IA 32-bit .dll on a AMD 64-bit platform

    (If you do not experience such problem, that is fine.)

    The reason behind this is that, the unowinreg.dll shipped with
OpenOffice SDK to find and run OpenOffice has only a 32-bit version,
which cannot be run with your 64-bit Java VM.  Currently 64-bit
unowinreg.dll is not available yet.  This has already been reported:

https://issues.apache.org/ooo/show_bug.cgi?id=121258

    You may try one of the following workarounds:

 1. Install 32-bit Java JRE on top of your 64-bit Java JRE.

 2. If you already have 32-bit Java JRE and 64-bit Java JRE installed
    together, with 64-bit Java JRE on top of 32-bit Java JRE, you
    may run from the command line with full path:

"C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre7\bin\java.exe" -jar calcmosaic.jar

    Alternatively, you may install WinJava64.reg that come with
    this package.  This will change the file association so that
    .jar files will be run with 32-bit Java JRE in the future.

    Thanks to 李振 goodser456@hotmail.com for helping me notice
this problem.
