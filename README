Calc Mosaic README


INTRODUCTION

    Calc Mosaic is a program to create mosaic art from images with
OpenOffice Calc.  This can be used to create cool stop motion movies.

    See HISTORY for the story behind Calc Mosaic.


COMPILATION

    You need JDK, Apache ANT and OpenOffice SDK in order to compile
this program.

    You need juh.jar, jurt.jar, ridl.jar and unoil.jar in order to
compile the source.  They can be found in OpenOffice SDK.

${OpenOffice Installation}/ure/share/java/juh.jar
${OpenOffice Installation}/ure/share/java/jurt.jar
${OpenOffice Installation}/ure/share/java/ridl.jar
${OpenOffice Installation}/basis3.4/program/classes/unoil.jar

    Just copy them into the lib/ directory and they will work.  Also
You may want to review the property value of ooo.dir.sdk-classes in
build.xml.

    To compile, simply type "ant compile".  Type "ant jar" will
create the jar file.  Type "ant help" for more information.

    Alternatively, there is a pre-compiled jar file here within
the distribution.


USAGE

    Type "java -jar calcmosaic.jar -help" to display a simple help.

    The snapshots of a video can be grabbed using ffmpeg:

ffmpeg -i video.mp4 -r <framerate> -sameq -y -f image2 img%04d.jpg

    Note that a spreadsheet document can only contain at most 256
spreadsheets.

    Save file first for the macro to work.
    
    Hit the start button at A1 of the first and last sheet to play
the sheets.

    You can set the break time (in milliseconds) between sheets at
B1 of the first sheet (default 100 ms).

    You can set the background music at C1 of the first sheet.  This
only works on Linux and you must install mplayer.  Relative file path
is relative to the document file.  Play once before your live show to
avoid the I/O delay with cache.

    If you found problem running on Windows X64, see Windows-x64.txt.
